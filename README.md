# Insurance Logistic Regression (Very Basic Project)

This is a **very basic machine learning project** created for learning and practice purposes.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented a **Logistic Regression** model on an insurance dataset to understand how different features affect the target outcome.

The goal of this project is **only to practice basic concepts**, not to build a production-level or optimized model.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `insurance.csv`  
  → The dataset used for training and testing the model  
- `insurance.ipynb`  
  → Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

## 🛠 Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- Basic data preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Model prediction and evaluation

## ⚠️ Note
This is a **very basic implementation** done as part of learning machine learning fundamentals.  
Advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or deployment are **not included**.
